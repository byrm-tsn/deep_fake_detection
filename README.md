# deep_fake_detection
It is my final year project at University of Roehampton 

Deep fake detection refers to the process of identifying and distinguishing between real and manipulated media content, particularly images and videos. Deep fakes are synthetic media that are created using deep learning techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), to manipulate or replace the original content with highly realistic but fake content.

Deep fake detection is an important area of research and development due to the potential risks and implications associated with the spread of manipulated media. By working on this project, you are contributing to the advancement of techniques and tools that can help identify and combat the spread of deep fakes.
